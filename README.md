## Project Description

This project showcases a basic CRUD application using React.js for the frontend and Axios for API calls. It is designed to perform the following operations on data from a REST API:
- Create: Add new items to the database.
- Read: Display a list of items.
- Update: Edit existing items.
- Delete: Remove items from the list.

The goal of this project is to provide a simple, functional CRUD application that is intuitive for users and demonstrates proficiency with core React concepts and HTTP requests via Axios.

## Features

- **Add new items**: Users can create and add new records.
- **View item list**: Fetches and displays a list of items from a REST API.
- **Update items**: Modify details of existing records.
- **Delete items**: Remove records from the database.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes.

## Tech Stack

- **React.js**: Used for building the user interface.
- **Axios**: Handles HTTP requests to the REST API.
- **REST API**: Provides data interaction endpoints (replace with the actual API if available).
- **Vercel**: Platform for deploying and hosting the application.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your system.
- **NPM or Yarn**: A package manager to install dependencies.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/get-shrabon/axios-crud-operation-react.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd axios-crud-operation-react
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or if you use Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Configuration

1. **API Base URL**: Create an `.env` file in the root directory and add the base URL for your REST API:
   ```plaintext
   REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"
   ```
2. **Axios Configuration**: Axios will use the environment variable for requests.

## Usage

### Running the Application Locally

To start the application in development mode, run:
```bash
npm start
```
or with Yarn:
```bash
yarn start
```

The application will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Performing CRUD Operations

1. **Create**: Fill out the form to add a new item, then submit to save it in the database.
2. **Read**: View the full list of items fetched from the API upon page load.
3. **Update**: Click the "Edit" button next to an item to modify its details.
4. **Delete**: Click the "Delete" button to remove an item from the list.

### Deployment

1. **Vercel Setup**: If you havenâ€™t already, install the Vercel CLI globally.
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```
2. **Login to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```
3. **Deploy** the project by running the following command:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```
   Follow the prompts to complete the deployment. Once complete, Vercel will provide a live URL where the application is hosted.

## Future Improvements

- **Form Validation**: Add validation for input fields to improve data integrity.
- **Error Handling**: Display more detailed error messages for failed API requests.
- **Loading State**: Implement a loading spinner or message during data fetch operations.
- **Pagination**: Add pagination for better handling of large datasets.

## Acknowledgements

This project is intended to demonstrate the basics of CRUD operations in a React environment using Axios for API interactions. Special thanks to all open-source contributors and resources used to complete this project.
